Building attainable applications with Flux
---

Facebook's Flux architecture is designed to make managing complex and dynamic views simple and maintainable. This talk focuses on how Flux provides a solid base for creating and scaling front-end applications, regardless of framework or size. We will build a small application and gradually scale it out, showing how Flux helps encourage sustainable decisions each step of the way.
